		Computes the gradient function for function f via backpropagation.
		
		Args:
		  input: A list of `Tensor` objects. a list of input tensors of size N + M;
		  Tout: A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.
		    the type list for the input list.
		  f: A function decorated with @Defun.
		    The function we want to compute the gradient for.
		
		    The function 'f' must be a numerical function which takes N inputs and
		    produces M outputs. Its gradient function 'g', which is computed by
		    this SymbolicGradient op is a function taking N + M inputs and
		    produces N outputs.
		
		    I.e. if we have
		       (y1, y2, ..., y_M) = f(x1, x2, ..., x_N),
		    then, g is
		       (dL/dx1, dL/dx2, ..., dL/dx_N) = g(x1, x2, ..., x_N,
		                                         dL/dy1, dL/dy2, ..., dL/dy_M),
		
		    where L is a scalar-value function of (x1, x2, ..., xN) (e.g., the
		    loss function). dL/dx_i is the partial derivative of L with respect
		    to x_i.
		
		    (Needs some math expert to say the comment above better.)
		  name: A name for the operation (optional).
		
		Returns:
		  A list of `Tensor` objects of type `Tout`.

		map on the list of tensors unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0.
		
		The simplest version of `map_fn` repeatedly applies the callable `fn` to a
		sequence of elements from first to last. The elements are made of the
		tensors unpacked from `elems`. `dtype` is the data type of the return
		value of `fn`. Users must provide `dtype` if it is different from
		the data type of `elems`.
		
		Suppose that `elems` is unpacked into `values`, a list of tensors. The shape
		of the result tensor is `[values.shape[0]] + fn(values[0]).shape`.
		
		This method also allows multi-arity `elems` and output of `fn`.  If `elems`
		is a (possibly nested) list or tuple of tensors, then each of these tensors
		must have a matching first (unpack) dimension.  The signature of `fn` may
		match the structure of `elems`.  That is, if `elems` is
		`(t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]])`, then an appropriate signature for `fn` is:
		`fn = lambda (t1, [t2, t3, [t4, t5]]):`.
		
		Furthermore, `fn` may emit a different structure than its input.  For example,
		`fn` may look like: `fn = lambda t1: return (t1 + 1, t1 - 1)`.  In this case,
		the `dtype` parameter is not optional: `dtype` must be a type or (possibly
		nested) tuple of types matching the output of `fn`.
		
		To apply a functional operation to the nonzero elements of a SparseTensor
		one of the following methods is recommended. First, if the function is
		expressible as TensorFlow ops, use
		
		```python
		  result = SparseTensor(input.indices, fn(input.values), input.dense_shape)
		```
		
		If, however, the function is not expressible as a TensorFlow op, then use
		
		```python
		result = SparseTensor(
		  input.indices, map_fn(fn, input.values), input.dense_shape)
		```
		
		instead.
		
		Args:
		  fn: The callable to be performed.  It accepts one argument, which will
		    have the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output
		    must have the same structure as `dtype` if one is provided, otherwise
		    it must have the same structure as `elems`.
		  elems: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which
		    will be unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence
		    of the resulting slices will be applied to `fn`.
		  dtype: (optional) The output type(s) of `fn`.  If `fn` returns a structure
		    of Tensors differing from the structure of `elems`, then `dtype` is not
		    optional and must have the same structure as the output of `fn`.
		  parallel_iterations: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
		    in parallel.
		  back_prop: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
		  swap_memory: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
		  infer_shape: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
		  name: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the
		  results of applying `fn` to tensors unpacked from `elems` along the first
		  dimension, from first to last.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of
		    `fn` and `dtype` do not match, or if elems is a SparseTensor.
		  ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `dtype` do not match.
		
		Examples:
		  ```python
		  elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		  squares = map_fn(lambda x: x * x, elems)
		  # squares == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
		  ```
		
		  ```python
		  elems = (np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([-1, 1, -1]))
		  alternate = map_fn(lambda x: x[0] * x[1], elems, dtype=tf.int64)
		  # alternate == [-1, 2, -3]
		  ```
		
		  ```python
		  elems = np.array([1, 2, 3])

	/**
		scan on the list of tensors unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0.
		
		The simplest version of `scan` repeatedly applies the callable `fn` to a
		sequence of elements from first to last. The elements are made of the tensors
		unpacked from `elems` on dimension 0. The callable fn takes two tensors as
		arguments. The first argument is the accumulated value computed from the
		preceding invocation of fn. If `initializer` is None, `elems` must contain
		at least one element, and its first element is used as the initializer.
		
		Suppose that `elems` is unpacked into `values`, a list of tensors. The shape
		of the result tensor is `[len(values)] + fn(initializer, values[0]).shape`.
		
		This method also allows multi-arity `elems` and accumulator.  If `elems`
		is a (possibly nested) list or tuple of tensors, then each of these tensors
		must have a matching first (unpack) dimension.  The second argument of
		`fn` must match the structure of `elems`.
		
		If no `initializer` is provided, the output structure and dtypes of `fn`
		are assumed to be the same as its input; and in this case, the first
		argument of `fn` must match the structure of `elems`.
		
		If an `initializer` is provided, then the output of `fn` must have the same
		structure as `initializer`; and the first argument of `fn` must match
		this structure.
		
		For example, if `elems` is `(t1, [t2, t3])` and `initializer` is
		`[i1, i2]` then an appropriate signature for `fn` in `python2` is:
		`fn = lambda (acc_p1, acc_p2), (t1 [t2, t3]):` and `fn` must return a list,
		`[acc_n1, acc_n2]`.  An alternative correct signature for `fn`, and the
		 one that works in `python3`, is:
		`fn = lambda a, t:`, where `a` and `t` correspond to the input tuples.
		
		Args:
		  fn: The callable to be performed.  It accepts two arguments.  The first
		    will have the same structure as `initializer` if one is provided,
		    otherwise it will have the same structure as `elems`.  The second
		    will have the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output
		    must have the same structure as `initializer` if one is provided,
		    otherwise it must have the same structure as `elems`.
		  elems: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which
		    will be unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence
		    of the resulting slices will be the first argument to `fn`.
		  initializer: (optional) A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors,
		    initial value for the accumulator, and the expected output type of `fn`.
		  parallel_iterations: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
		    in parallel.
		  back_prop: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
		  swap_memory: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
		  infer_shape: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
		  name: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
		
		Returns:
		  A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors.  Each tensor packs the
		  results of applying `fn` to tensors unpacked from `elems` along the first
		  dimension, and the previous accumulator value(s), from first to last.
		
		Raises:
		  TypeError: if `fn` is not callable or the structure of the output of
		    `fn` and `initializer` do not match.
		  ValueError: if the lengths of the output of `fn` and `initializer`
		    do not match.
		
		Examples:
		  ```python
		  elems = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
		  sum = scan(lambda a, x: a + x, elems)
		  # sum == [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21]
