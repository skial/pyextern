		`checkpointable` and its dependencies are restored. The restorations are

		`_track_checkpointable` is more appropriate for adding a
		normal/unconditional dependency, and includes handling for deferred
		restorations. This method allows objects such as `Optimizer` to use the same
		restoration logic while managing conditional dependencies themselves, by
		overriding `_checkpoint_dependencies` and `_lookup_dependency` to change the
		object's dependencies based on the context it is saved/restored in (a single
		optimizer instance can have state associated with multiple graphs).
		
		Args:
		  name: The name of the dependency within this object (`self`), used to
